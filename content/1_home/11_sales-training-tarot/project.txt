Description: When Codman Specialty Surgical was acquired by Integra LifeSciences, newly integrated sales teams needed to quickly learn about an expanded product portfolio. To address this, a training tool was developed in the form of a tarot deck, with each card showcasing a different product. The pattern which runs through the deck ties together the themes of tarot and neurosurgery.
